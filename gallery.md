Each loaf of bread I've made so far, from oldest to newest. You can see as they tend to get progressively less terrible. Remember, it's a process! And nearly every one of these loaves still tasted good, so even if the rise is bad, not all is lost. Some days will be better than others; that's inevitable when you're working with a live culture.

First kneaded loaf (as opposed to lazy method). Nice rise, no taste.
