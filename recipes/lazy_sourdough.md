### Introduction

This recipe is a sourdough adaptation, given to me by my professor, of a New York Times article for [no-knead bread](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread). The idea with this bread is that, instead of kneading, you just let it ferment for a long time. This straightens out the gluten and allows the yeast to do its work.

*The following text is copied from the recipe given to me. I did not write it, I only changed the order of some paragraphs and added a few additional notes.*
### Making The Dough

Firstly, make sure that your sourdough starter is bubbly and active. You'll need a cup of it for this recipe. A good rhythm is to take your sourdough starter out of the fridge in the morning and start feeding it, stir in a half cup of flour and some water a couple of times in the day and let it get nice and bubbly. 

Mix up your dough in the evening. I like to mix the water and starter first, which allows the starter to dissolve a bit, and then add the flour and salt. Put some saran wrap over the top of the bowl and let it rise slowly all night at room temperature (about 10-12 hours). I would err on the side of less time, especially if you're in a warm environment, to avoid over-proofing. Bake it in the morning.

### Preparing To Bake

Put the pot and lid in which you plan to bake the bread into an oven and pre-heat to 500 ºF, or as hot as your oven can go. The best pan to use as a cloche would be a ceramic or cast iron casserole with a lid, but metal pots are OK too, so long as they don't have any plastic or other pieces that could melt. You want to make sure that the pot is at least 5-6 inches tall from floor to rim to make sure there is enough room for the rising loaf.

### Forming The Loaf

While the pots are heating, form the loaves. Sprinkle your surface with LOTS of flour. Dump the dough in the middle and carefully fold the four corners into the center. The dough will be too sticky to knead, so handle it minimally with well-floured hands. The whole ball of dough should be well dusted with flour. Flip it over, folded side down, and put it on a piece of saran wrap and let it rest for a few minutes. You can use the same piece of saran wrap that you used earlier to cover the bowl!

### Baking

When the oven is thoroughly pre-heated, remove the pots from oven carefully with oven mitts and remove lid. When you are ready to flip the dough into the pot, slide your left hand under the saran wrap and invert it into your right hand. Make sure you rub some flour on your hand first. Peel the saran wrap off your left hand and dump it into the pre-heated pan. Make sure the fold is on top when you drop it into the hot pan so that the loaf breaks on top as it is baking to let the steam out.  Bake 30 minutes at 500 ºF with the lid on and take it off for the last 15 minutes at 450 ºF so that it browns on top. If your oven only goes to 450, no problem.
