**Ingredients**

- 2 cups white flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 2 cups starter
- 1 heaping spoonful fine salt
- 1 spoonful sesame seeds
- 2 spoonfuls olive oil
- 1.5 cups water

**Process**

1. Mix dry ingredients in bowl, then add olive oil and starter, and gradually mix in water until the dough is wet and sticky but can hold a shape.
2. Allow the dough to rest for ~10 min.
2. Knead for about 10 min, adding flour as needed but sparingly so the dough doesn't become too stiff. I find that I can sometimes use the stickiness of the dough to help with stretching during kneading. A bench scraper comes in very handy for this.
3. Place into lightly oiled pot, covered with plastic wrap, for ~3 hours of fermentation. Every 45 min or so, gently stretch the dough and fold it over itself a few times. You want to let the dough stretch as much as possible, but don't tug it -- allow the gluten to release on its own, so you don't tear the dough. 
4. Form a loaf and place into a proofing basket for 2 hours. It should expand significantly during this time. My loaf didn't quite double, but it did get larger. When it's soft and pillowy, it's ready to bake.
5. Score and bake at 500F in a covered pot for 30 min followed by 15 min at 450F in an uncovered pot.

**Notes**
- I had much better luck with the dough rising this time. I used fine salt instead of coarse, and I stretched it more during the kneading phase, which I think really helped the gluten development.
  - I noticed during the folding/fermenting phase that the dough was much more willing to stretch than yesterday.

Crumb compared to yesterday's loaf (on the right). Much better oven spring!
