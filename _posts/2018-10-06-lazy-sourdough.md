Today is my first attempt to make "lazy sourdough" bread, which is a recipe given to me by my professor on this trip. It involves no kneading, instead letting time do all of the work of leavening the bread. She adapted it from a New York Times post on how to make regular bread (i.e. using commercial yeast) with this method.

My understanding of kneading, based on [this article](https://www.thespruceeats.com/the-science-of-kneading-dough-1328690), is that it helps to line up the gluten proteins and strengthens the dough. However, the author also notes that extended periods of fermentation have a similar effect by breaking up proteins and causing the dough to rise. This recipe involves a 12 hour (!!) fermentation process.

### The Starter

The recipe requires 1 cup of sourdough starter, but I only had a few tablespoons of it, so I took it out last night, mixed it with about a half cup of flour and water to achieve a pancake-batter like consistency, and let it ferment overnight. Then, I fed it a few spoonfuls of flour and some water every few hours today until it was nice and bubbly.

### The Dough

I mixed up the dough around 10pm tonight, covered it in plastic wrap. I'll let it rest overnight, around 12 hours, then bake it and see how it goes!
