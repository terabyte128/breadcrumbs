Today I took the same proportions and basic methodology from [my previous sourdough post]({{"/2018/10/10/free-form-sourdough.html" | relative_url}}) but replaced one cup of white flour with whole-wheat flour in an attempt to get some more interesting flavor. I also added some sesame seeds, and I only kneaded the bread once before allowing it to rise.

Unfortunately, I think I didn't add enough salt, so it didn't have much flavor. Here are a few photos of the process:

First rise, a few hours covered with a damp cloth

Proofing after forming the loaf, about an hour
