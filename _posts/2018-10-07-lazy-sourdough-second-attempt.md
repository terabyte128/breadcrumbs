### Update: Flour Types

For this bread, I used Italian 00 flour, which I later learned is the softest and finest variety of flour and is not really intended for use in bread. This was likely a factor in the bread's poor rising. The bread in this post rose better than the first time, so I think I'm on the right track, but I believe the flour is likely a factor as well. 

### Introduction

*This post is a follow-up to the ever-popular [Lazy Sourdough: First Attempt](/2018/10/06/lazy-sourdough.html).*

In the spirit of *if at first you don't succeed, try, try again*, I've decided to immediately try baking another round of the same recipe. This time around, I'm changing a few variables:

- shorter fermentation/proofing period: 10 hours instead of 12;
- being more precise with flour and water measurements; and
- making the dough a bit firmer than before.

I got the starter going in the same way as the first time: a day of periodic feeding with flour and water before I used it to make the dough in the evening.

### Mixing The Dough

The new dough, a few minutes after mixing up. I used a little more flour than last time so that it can hold its shape a bit better (though it's still quite wet). I would estimate that I used 1/4 cup more of flour than the recipe called for; this seemed to help the rise, but I later found out that the flour type may be more of a factor.

A few hours after mixing the dough.

I left the dough to ferment for 10 hours and woke up at 6:30am ðŸ˜´ to bake it.

### Forming The Loaf

After pre-heating the oven, I dumped a **lot** of flour on my workspace and used my fancy new silicone spatula to splap the dough out of the bowl and onto the table. After flouring my hands, I tucked over each of the four sides, then, since it was still sort of falling apart, I did that again. I'm not sure how doing it multiple times affects the rise. I flipped over the dough again and placed it on the plastic wrap for a little more proofing while the oven finished heating.

The dough on the floured table after folding over. It's difficult to tell from this photo, but this dough has a lot fewer holes than the dough from yesterday, and holds together a bit better.

The dough on the plastic wrap (protip: you can re-use the plastic wrap that you used to cover the bowl for this step!)

### Baking

I flipped the dough into the hot pot, covered with the lid, and baked for 30 min with the lid on and an additional 25 min with the lid off. I went a little longer than the prescribed time to allow the crust to brown a bit more.

### The Final Bread

It's definitely _better_ than the first attempt, but still doesn't have as much rise as I'd like. But now that I have a better understanding of different flour types, I'll try again with stronger flour and see the effect of that.

### Lessons Learned
- Italian 00 flour is not necessarily intended for bread making and may not rise as easily or produce as much gluten as stronger, coarser flours.
- Shorter fermentation time (10 hours vs. 12) may be helpful to prevent over-proofing, though it's unclear how much of the low rise was a result of the flour.
