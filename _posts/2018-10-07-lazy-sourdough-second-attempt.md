*This post is a follow-up to the ever-popular [Lazy Sourdough: First Attempt](/2018/10/06/lazy-sourdough.html).*

In the spirit of *if at first you don't succeed, try, try again*, I've decided to immediately try baking another round of the same recipe. This time around, I'm changing a few variables:

- shorter fermentation/proofing period: 10 hours instead of 12;
- being more precise with flour and water measurements; and
- making the dough a bit firmer than before.

The new dough, a few minutes after mixing up. I used a little more flour than last time so that it can hold its shape a bit better (though it's still quite wet).
