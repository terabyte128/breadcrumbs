Hey, it's been a while! I figured I'd post a quick update just on the off chance that someone is actually reading this blog and was disappointed that I stopped posting.

I'm back in Seattle now, studying computer science again. This means I won't be regularly updating this blog anymore --- but worry not, I'm still baking plenty of bread.

I wrote [this paper](assets/paper.pdf) about my experience with sourdough baking as a final project for my study abroad experience --- fair warning, it does get a bit preachy at the end, but I like to think it's _somewhat_ of an interesting read at least.

I may be back occasionally to post bread photos here, but more likely I'll put any future updates on my [main website](http://samwolfson.com), so head over there if you're interested in what I've been up to lately :)
