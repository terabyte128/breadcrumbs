**Ingredients**

- 2 cups white flour
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- ~1.5 cups starter
- 1 heaping spoonful coarse salt
- ~1/4 cup olive oil
- ~1 cup water

**Process**

1. Mix ingredients in bowl.
2. Knead for about 10 min, adding flour as needed.
3. Place into lightly oiled pot, covered with plastic wrap, for ~4 hours of fermentation. Every 45 min or so, gently stretch the dough and fold it over itself a few times. 
4. Form a loaf and place into a proofing basket for another few hours.
5. Bake at 500F in a covered pot for 30 min followed by 15 min at 450F in an uncovered pot.

**Notes**

- The rise was not as good as I had hoped. I think this is at least partially due to the coarse salt I used, which may have unevenly affected fermentation.
  - I also noticed that the dough had some small holes and imperfections on the surface, which I think indicates that the gluten was not as strong as it should have been. Again, the large grains of salt may have also poked holes in the bubbles. This also meant that the final crust of the baked bread was shaggy and uneven (or, maybe just "artisanal.")
- My kneading technique definitely leaves room for improvement. I didn't stretch the dough as much as I should have.
- The bread has a good sour taste, though! But I think I may have used too much salt.
