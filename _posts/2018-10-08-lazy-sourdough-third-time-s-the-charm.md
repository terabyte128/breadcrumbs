This is a very similar process to the <a href="{{ '/2018/10/07/lazy-sourdough-second-attempt.html' | relative_url }}">second time I made this bread</a>. The main difference is that the dough is slightly drier than last time; however, this turns out to still be a bit too wet. 

I'll mainly be documenting this with photos since the method is largely the same.

Note that this dough, while dryer than last time, is still wetter than recommended for this bread. See the recipe linked at the top of this page for a visual reference of how the dough should look.

This is the consistency of my starter. Note that it's also a bit thicker than last time. Your starter may be different, but starters with higher relative water content will require a higher flour to water ratio in the dough so ensure that it's not too wet.

This is my dough after about 10 hours of rising. Still quite thin, but workable. I used my rubber spatula to carefully pour it onto a **well-floured** work surface and gently formed it into a loaf by tucking over the front, bottom, and both sides.

I flipped over the dough onto plastic wrap and let it rest for about half an hour while the oven heated up. I baked for 30 min in a metal pot with the lid on, followed by about 20 min with the lid off.

The finished loaf & crumb shot -- not bad! More rise than the past few times.

### Lessons Learned
- Dough is still too watery! More flour should be used to make it easier to work. See the photo in the linked recipe.
